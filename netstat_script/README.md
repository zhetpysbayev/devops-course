I am writing a script for the first time, a lot of copy-paste from the Internet
There should be a description of the script that I am currently parsing

This script looks at the open ports and which program is running. It is possible to set the number of lines. Also, with the help of "awk", the received data is processed and only the specified columns are displayed. Next, with the "whois" team, we receive information about the organization at the SP address.
